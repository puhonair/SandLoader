/**
 * SandLoader's own patches against the renderer bundle.
 *
 * There is deliberately only one required patch. Sandustry already ships a
 * complete internal modding API - the object the bundle calls `FH`, carrying
 * `events`, `elements`, `structures`, `terrains`, `items`, `world`, `ui`,
 * `sound`, `workers` and more - but it never publishes it to `window`.
 *
 * So SMLN does not reimplement any of that. It captures the game's own API
 * object at the moment the game announces it is ready, and hands it to mods.
 * One hook, and the entire first-party surface comes with it.
 *
 * ANCHORING, AND THE `variants` LIST
 *
 * Every anchor hangs off a string literal the game's *source* controls, never
 * a byte offset, a minified identifier or a module id. Comparing 0.5.4 with
 * 0.5.5 shows why that holds up:
 *
 *     0.5.4   ie.FH.events.emit(p,"game:ready",{state:p})
 *     0.5.5   ie.FH.events.emit(g,"game:ready",{state:g})
 *     0.5.4   (0,$s.t)("ui|mainMenu|mods")
 *     0.5.5   (0,Gs.t)("ui|mainMenu|mods")
 *
 * Only local names moved, and the backreferences and character classes below
 * already absorb that. The realistic future break is not the literal
 * disappearing, it is the *shape around it* shifting - a payload gaining a
 * field, a call losing its namespace prefix.
 *
 * `variants` is that contingency: ordered fallbacks, loosest last, all anchored
 * on the same literal. src/patch/autoheal.js tries them in order when the
 * primary stops matching, and adopts the first whose output still parses.
 * `anchorLiteral` names the invariant so that, when nothing resolves, the
 * report can show where it still appears instead of just saying "failed".
 *
 * Every patch declares how many matches it expects. Getting 0 is a failure;
 * getting more is *also* a failure, because a pattern that silently became
 * ambiguous would otherwise corrupt the bundle in several places at once.

   * `y` is in world pixels and y=0 is the top, so both numbers are the strip's
   * absolute height in pixels - not a fraction of anything.
   *
   * A SandLoader custom map leaves `store.world.externalMap` null, so both
   * fallbacks apply, and they were picked for the world the game itself ships:
   * 3840x3840 cells at cellSize 4, so 15360 pixels tall. There a 600-pixel
   * strip is 3.9% of the world. Put the same 600 pixels on the smallest map
   * the editor will make - 201 cells, 804 pixels - and it is 75% of the world.
   * The map gets shorter; the ceiling does not.
   *
   * WHY NOT JUST SET `externalMap`
   *
   * Because it is not a bag of optional fields. `getActive` clones every
   * descriptor through a normaliser that reads `t.spawn.x`, `t.unstuck.x`,
   * `t.topBounds.hard` and `t.depthLight.startY` with no optional chaining, so
   * a partial descriptor throws the moment anything asks for the active map,
   * and a complete one would mean inventing a spawn point, an unstuck point
   * and a depth-light curve. The fallback is the only thing that is wrong, so
   * the fallback is the only thing these two patches touch.
   *
   * ANCHORING
   *
   * On `topBounds.soft` / `topBounds.hard` plus the shape of the fallback the
   * TypeScript downlevelling emits around it. Verified against the shipped
   * 0.5.6 bundle: `topBounds` appears nine times, and each of these matches
   * exactly one of them. The other seven are the normaliser above (which reads
   * the property, never defaults it) and an `Object.freeze`.
   *
   * NEITHER IS REQUIRED. A build that reshapes either literal costs the
   * ceiling fix and nothing else: the expression falls back to the game's own
   * number, which is what an unpatched game uses, so the map is still
   * playable - just with vanilla's ceiling over it.
