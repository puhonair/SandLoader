/**
 * A handle on the game's own webpack module registry.
 *
 * Sandustry's renderer is a webpack bundle. Most of what a mod needs is reached
 * through the Sandkit API, but a few things are only available as module
 * exports and never put on a global or on FH - React, react-dom, and the tech
 * tree's grid among them.
 *
 * Webpack's chunk array is the supported way in. Pushing a chunk whose third
 * element is a callback hands us the real `__webpack_require__`:
 *
 *   webpackChunksand_v1.push([[id], {}, (req) => { ... }])
 *
 * We keep that `req` and expose two operations on top of it:
 *
 *   get(id)        - load one module by id
 *   find(predicate) - scan the registry for a module by *shape*
 *
 * `find` is the one to prefer. Minified module ids are regenerated on every
 * game build, so an id is true for exactly one version; a shape check ("has
 * createElement and useState") survives rebuilds. Ids remain useful only as a
 * fast path, and every caller here treats them as a hint, never a requirement.
 *
 * Nothing in this file assumes the scan will succeed. Reaching into a private
 * module graph is archaeology, and it must fail soft: callers get null and
 * report it, rather than the renderer throwing.
