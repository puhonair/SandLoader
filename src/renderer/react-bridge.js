/**
 * Hand the game's own React to mods that draw UI.
 *
 * Official Sandkit mods receive `sandkit.react` and immediately destructure it:
 *
 *   const React = sandkit.react
 *   const h = React.createElement      // top level, so null throws instantly
 *
 * The game bundles React 18.3.1 as a webpack module and never puts it on a
 * global, so `global.React` is undefined and `sandkit.react` was null. Six of
 * the eleven bundled mods died on exactly that line - the whole entry, before
 * any of their own logic ran.
 *
 * Mods must get the *same* React instance the game renders with. A second copy
 * would have its own dispatcher, and any hook called from a mod component would
 * throw "invalid hook call" - so bundling our own React is not an option.
 *
 * Webpack's chunk array is the supported way in. Pushing a chunk whose third
 * element is a callback hands us the real `__webpack_require__`, from which we
 * pull the live module out of the running instance's cache:
 *
 *   webpackChunksand_v1.push([[id], {}, (req) => { React = req(MODULE) }])
 *
 * The module id is found by probing rather than hardcoded: minified ids are
 * regenerated on every game build, so `74159` is true for 0.5.5 and a liability
 * afterwards. We look for the module whose exports actually look like React,
 * and only fall back to known ids if the scan finds nothing.
